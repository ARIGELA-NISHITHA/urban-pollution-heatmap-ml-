-R² Score tells you how well your model explains variance in the target variable. Closer to 1 is better.

-RMSE gives the average prediction error in the same unit as the target (e.g., µg/m³).

-Consider these accuracy ranges:


| R² Score  | Interpretation    |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| > 0.9     | Excellent fit     |
| 0.8 – 0.9 | Good fit          |
| 0.6 – 0.8 | Moderate fit      |
| < 0.6     | Needs improvement |
